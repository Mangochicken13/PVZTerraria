# PVZTerraria
A Terraria mod themed around the Plants vs Zombies franchise.  

This mod aims to add PvZ themed content throughout the entire vanilla terraria progression, with the intention of making a fully playable class as well as maybe a boss or two ðŸ˜‰

Im aware that the organisation method in this github repo is hot garbage, if it gets too much worse im considering re-making the repo entirely  
However, this is my first major project, and a learning experience, so despite probably leaking personal information in some old commits, they will remain for now, as documentation of how much of a dumbass i am lol

If you want to pop into my empty, cobweb ridden discord server for this mod the link is discord.gg/FGcyRCxVNR  
Alternatively, if you want to talk to me directly my discord account is @mangochicken_  
Feel free to ask me to add stuff, or present concepts for a plant's adaption into the mod, or even original plants: I'm more or less open to suggestions
