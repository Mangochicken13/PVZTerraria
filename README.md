# PVZTerraria
 A Terraria mod themed around the Plants vs Zombies franchise. 
 This mod aims to add PvZ themed content throughout the entire vanilla terraria progression, with the intention of making a fully playable class as well as maybe a boss or two ðŸ˜‰

Im aware that the organisation methods in this github repo is hot garbage, if it gets too much worse im considering re-making the repo entirely
However, this is my first major project, and a learning experience, so despite probably leaking personal information in some old commits, they will remain for now, as documentation of how much of a dumbass i am lol
