This is an in-progress mod themed around the Plants Vs Zombies franchise.

The Plants are all going to be moved into the summon damage class, as a sub-sub-class of sentries. They do not require sentry slots as of yet, although some of the more powerful ones may in the future.

A majority of the sprites in this mod are a work in progress, as such, don't have high hopes for incredible graphics at the moment. I will still try to get them to a serviceable level before making anything obtainable, but I'm a programmer first and artist second.

Currently adds:
  2 useable items (fires a projectile + has a (potentially temporary) crafting recipe)
	- I recommend using recipe browser if you have trouble
  1 resource (sun)
	- It shows the UI when you hold one of the plant packets, or always shows if you toggle the config
  3 pickups (similar to hearts/mana stars)
	- only one (25 sun) is currently naturally available (from the sunflower), others will be used in future with other sun producers

Now with a fancy new icon :sparkle:

If you have any questions feel free to hop into the discord at discord.gg/FGcyRCxVNR (the server is very small, and also barely properly set up as of yet)

insert text with "Plants Vs Zombies" in it so it shows up when you search for "PvZ"
