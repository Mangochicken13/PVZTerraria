This is an in-progress mod themed around the Plants Vs Zombies franchise.

Currently adds:
  2 useable items (fires a projectile + has a (potentially temporary) crafting recipe)
	- I recommend using recipe browser if you have trouble
  1 damage class (plant damage)
    - Inherits 20% of summon damage's modifiers to armor penetration and crit chance, as well as all generic modifiers (think the 4% damage increase accessory modifiers)
  1 resource (sun)
	- It shows the UI when you hold one of the plant packets, or always shows if you toggle the config
  3 pickups (similar to hearts/mana stars)
	- only one (25 sun) is currently naturally available (from the sunflower)

Now with a fancy new icon :sparkle:

If you have any questions feel free to hop into the discord at discord.gg/FGcyRCxVNR (the server is very small, and also barely properly set up as of yet)

insert text with "Plants Vs Zombies" in it so it shows up when you search for "PvZ"
